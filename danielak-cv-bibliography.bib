We argue that research approaches that privilege canonical knowledge do so at the expense of other productive knowledge and ways of knowing that students have. We explore applicable cognitive theory by showing how manifold models of cognition can be powerful frameworks for analysis in Computing Education (CEd). Finally, we conclude with an exploration of epistemological concerns, arguing that a fundamental concern for our research community should be paying attention to what counts as knowledge and knowing in computing learning environments.},

  abstract = {This collection of functions in granovaGG     provides what we call elemental graphics for display of     anova results. The term elemental derives from the fact     that each function is aimed at construction of     graphical displays that afford direct visualizations of     data with respect to the fundamental questions that     drive the particular anova methods. This package     represents a modification of the original granova     package; the key change is to use ggplot2, Hadley     Wickham's package based on Grammar of Graphics concepts     (due to Wilkinson). The main function is granovagg.1w     (a graphic for one way anova); two other functions     (granovagg.ds and granovagg.contr) are to construct     graphics for dependent sample analyses and     contrast-based analyses respectively. (The function     granova.2w, which entails dynamic displays of data, is     not currently part of granovaGG.) The granovaGG     functions are to display data for any number of groups,     regardless of their sizes (however, very large data     sets or numbers of groups can be problematic). For     granovagg.1w a specialized approach is used to     construct data-based contrast vectors for which anova     data are displayed. The result is that the graphics use     a straight line to facilitate clear interpretations     while being faithful to the standard effect test in     anova. The graphic results are complementary to     standard summary tables; indeed, numerical summary     statistics are provided as side effects of the graphic     constructions. granovagg.ds and granovagg.contr provide     graphic displays and numerical outputs for a dependent     sample and contrast-based analyses. The graphics based     on these functions can be especially helpful for     learning how the respective methods work to answer the     basic question(s) that drive the analyses. This means     they can be particularly helpful for students and     non-statistician analysts. But these methods can be of     assistance for work-a-day applications of many kinds,     as they can help to identify outliers, clusters or     patterns, as well as highlight the role of non-linear     transformations of data. In the case of granovagg.1w     and granovagg.ds several arguments are provided to     facilitate flexibility in the construction of graphics     that accommodate diverse features of data, according to     their corresponding display requirements. See the help     files for individual functions.}

We present and interpret data from clinical interviews and classroom video of "Michael," a student who feels marginalized by an engineering program that undervalues him because of his stance toward knowledge [2],[3]. Michael is a sophomore Electrical Engineering and Mathematics major in a Basic Circuits course. In his own words, he's a "fringe" student because of his robust tendency to try making sense of the concepts being taught rather than memorizing formulae. He also feels alienated because he views learning in terms of argument and intuition, not algorithm and rote acceptance. Furthermore, for Michael the practice of sense-making defines him; it's an integral aspect of his identity [4]. Thus, Michael's self-reported sense of alienation resonates strongly with existing identity-based accounts of students leaving the field [5],[6]. We contend the field of engineering suffers if individuals like Michael don't pursue it. Through this case study of Michael, we urge the retention discussion to consider not just the demographic categories of people we hope to keep, but also the approaches to knowledge, learning, and problem-solving we aim to support.},

  abstract = {Background Students' identities and sense of belonging in a program affect whether they stay in engineering. Research suggests that students' ways of knowing and beliefs about what counts as knowing and learning \textendash{} their personal epistemologies \textendash{} can be aspects of their identities, or sense of self as knowers and learners. Purpose/Hypothesis Combining personal epistemology and identity theories suggests epistemological aspects of students' identities can influence whether they feel they belong in their engineering program. We have two research questions: Can a high-achieving engineering student be in danger of leaving a program because of a mismatch between epistemological aspects of his identity and his perceptions of the intellectual climate of their program? How does such a mismatch affect the student's day-to-day academic experiences? Design/Method For three years, we followed Michael, an electrical engineering student, through interviews and in-class observations. From more than 12 hours of semistructured clinical interviews, more than 10 hours of videotaped discussion sections, and two in-class observations in lectures, we produced a case study to characterize epistemological aspects of Michael's identity and how they influenced his perception of his program. Results Michael expressed and enacted a sense-making epistemology that is a fundamental aspect of his identity as a learner. Due to this sense-making aspect of Michael's identity, he often felt alienated from the intellectual climate of his program, and he considered leaving engineering. Conclusion Researchers focused on student retention should attend to epistemological aspects of student identities. Instructors and administrators focused on retention should attend to the epistemological messages students hear from their programs.},

Treating design as inseparable from the work of engineering [3], we propose a trajectory for how some students develop and enact views of design practice. We analyze two distinct but thematically coherent streams of data, arguing that early course experiences can strongly color how students later come to treat design work. In one stream we follow ``Michael,'' a freshman engineering student at a large public university. Michael develops practical strategies to cope with an engineering program that (to him) undervalues mathematical sense-making and subjugates conceptual reasoning beneath calculation [4]. Our second data stream follows the activity patterns of a student team in a design capstone course at another large public university. For this team, there is a marked tension among its members between treating their task as a legitimate design project versus simply a schoolish exercise. Our analysis treats both streams\textemdash Michael and the design team\textemdash as bounding a single hybrid case [5]. By interpreting across time, location, and learning context we consider how the team data prefigure the trajectory of Michael, and how Michael's experiences explain the interactions in the design team [6].}

Michael wondered if current is defined as moving charge and the ideal conductor is by definition neutral, how could one calculate the current through it? This question is thornier than it first appears. We will show how Michael's identity as a sense-maker, an identity defined in part by its oppositional relation to many aspects of Michael's engineering program, influences how he approaches this problem, and how his approach reinforces his identity.}

Education researchers have also documented correlations between emotions (such as joy, anxiety, fear, curiosity, boredom) and academic performance. Nonetheless, most research on students' reasoning and conceptual change within the learning sciences and physics and science education research has not attended to the role of learners' emotions in describing or modeling the fine timescale dynamics of their conceptual reasoning. The few studies that integrate emotions into models of learners' cognition have mostly done so at a coarse grain size. In this study, toward the long-term goal of incorporating emotions into models of in-the-moment cognitive dynamics, we present a case study of Judy, an undergraduate electrical engineering and physics major. We show that shifts in the intensity of a fine-grained aspect of Judy's emotions, her annoyance at conceptual homework problems, co-occur with shifts in her epistemological stance toward differentiating knowledge about and the practical utility of real circuits and idealized circuit models. We then argue for the plausibility of a cognitive model in which Judy's emotions and epistemological stances mutually affect each other. We end with discussions on how models of learners' cognition that incorporate their emotions are generative for instructional purposes and research on learning.},
