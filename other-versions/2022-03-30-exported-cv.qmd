# Work Experience

## LECTURER

*University of Maryland -- College Park*

August 2019--Present

> I work as part of the university's Keystone Program in the A. James Clark School of Engineering. I teach Introduction to Engineering Design: a groupwork-focused course where teams of students develop autonomous robots. I also teach Engineering Dynamics, the study of forces and motion.

## SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INSTRUCTOR  {#software-engineering-instructor}

*FullStack Academy of Code* (https://www.fullstackacademy.com/)

October 2018--August 2019

> FullStack Academy is a coding bootcamp that trains students to become web developers and software engineers through a 13-week immersive on-site program. The curriculum covers route handling, database layers, API design, component-based user interface design, and core topics in data structures and algorithms. I taught students and designed curricular materials.

## SOFTWARE ENGINEER

*Reaktor Inc.* ([[https://www.reaktor.com/]{.underline}](https://www.reaktor.com/))

December 2017--August 2018

> Reaktor is a software consulting firm with offices in Helsinki, Amsterdam, Dubai, Tokyo, and New York. As a software engineer, I developed cutting-edge web applications for our clients. I worked across the entire software stack for the project, from client-side user interface code to server-side API design.

## RESEARCH ASSOCIATE

*The Concord Consortium* ([[https://concord.org]{.underline}](https://concord.org)) *InquirySpace 2*

*May 2017---November 2017, Chad Dorsey (PI)*

> The InquirySpace 2 project puts real-time sensors and powerful, free data analysis software in the hands of high school students. Its aim is to teach students design thinking for experiments, so they're equipped to pursue their own questions and laboratory experiments. My responsibilities included writing and reviewing curricula, as well as collecting and analyzing screencasts of students' work in the classroom. We ultimately used the data from those screencasts---as well as results from real-time log analytics while students work---to develop research accounts of how students' knowledge progresses as they learn experimental design.

## POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE

*Department of Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (CMSE)*

*2015--May 2017, Michigan State University, Brian O'Shea Ph.D. (PI)*

> I worked with Brian O'Shea to develop CMSE's flagship Introduction to Computational Modeling course. This course serves as a programming-based introduction to how STEM practitioners create, evaluate, and refine models through computation. We designed the course to be open to any major at the university---not strictly STEM majors. It requires no prior programming experience, and it includes multidisciplinary modeling examples from cellular biology; ecology; kinematics; agent-based economics and social behavior; and the digital humanities. My responsibilities included designing course curricula, teaching the course, and conducting rigorous learning science research on the course.

*Data Explorer and Assessment Resources for Physics Faculty (DEAR-Faculty)*

*2014--2015, American Association of Physics Teachers, Sarah McKagan (PI)*

> This project is built around a web portal where physics instructors can learn about research-validated assessments and find out how to use them in their courses. For this project, I developed a software system to automatically create assessment-specific implementation guides. I also conducted user interviews with faculty to understand how we can tune the database and its front-end to meet their needs.

*Learning Ethnographies of New Engineers (LENE), 2014, Northwestern University*

*Reed Stevens Ph.D. (PI) and Kevin O'Connor, Ph.D. (Co-PI)*

> LENE tried to understand what new engineers know and learn in their first six months in industry. We developed case studies to explore how what new engineers must learn to do on the job aligns (or doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t align) with what they learned to do when they were students. My role was lead ethnographer: I identified and followed recent engineering graduates, observing them at work and conducting interviews with them to develop detailed cases of their development.

*MakeScape, 2013 -- 2014, University of Wisconsin--Madison*

*Matthew Berland Ph.D. (PI) and Leilah Lyons, Ph.D. (Co-PI)*

> I co-designed an interactive game-based museum environment to support students' design thinking. Specifically, I worked with game designers and artists to develop the conceptual architecture and intended learning outcomes of the game. And, I worked with software engineers to design and implement specifications to collect in-game telemetry data. I also led weekly meetings of the Complex Play Lab.

*Learning Games PlayData Consortium, 2014 , University of Wisconsin--Madison*

*Matthew Berland Ph.D. (PI) and Kurt Squire, Ph.D. (Co-PI) & Richard Halverson Ph.D. (Co-PI)*

> I co-designed the frameworks for collecting, analyzing, and presenting in-game telemetry data. Working with software engineers, game designers, and learning science researchers I helped refine telemetry data specifications and develop visualization and statistical analysis tools. I also planned and coordinated meetings and workshops for key stakeholders on the project. I also wrote a book on how to analyze telemetry data from learning games: [[https://brian-danielak.gitbook.io/makescape-adage-gitbook/]{.underline}](https://brian-danielak.gitbook.io/makescape-adage-gitbook/)

## NSF DISCIPLINARY EXPERT IN SCIENCE EDUCATION FELLOW

*Exploring Students' Understanding of Modularized Code, 2011--2013, University of Maryland--College Park*

> Using my fellowship, I proposed an independent project that became the basis of my dissertation. I ethnographically observed an Introductory Programming for Engineers course. I arranged, conducted, transcribed, and analyzed ethnographic interviews with electrical engineering students. I co-developed a system to automatically capture snapshot histories of students' codebases. I also developed open-source tools for visualizing code evolution over time: *CodeTimeline* and *RepoStatistics*
